    <h1>Final Design</h1>
    <h3>After a few days of working on my barbeque scraper it is now complete.
        I have learned a lot from this project such as how to use tools and how to work with wood.
        This was an extremely fun project and I am waiting to continue creating more wood project in tech class in febuary.
        One thing I believe I could have done a bit better was the planning of my scraper.
        I believe I could've given more thoughts to my handle for things such as size of hole and the functionality of the handle.
        Something I believe I did well was hand sanding.
        My last step was sanding the entire project and I did this for multiple hours.
        I have used different kinds of sand paper (120, 150, 180, 220), on every edge for a long time until there were no scratches left and all the sides were very smooth.
        After a fun few weeks this is my completed project.
