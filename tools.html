                        The band saw is mainly used in woodworking and metalworking. 
                        The purpose of a band saw is to cut out shapes in wood, plastic, or metal.
                        One of its advantages over other saws is its ability to cut out irregular or curved sides and shapes.
                        <br><br><span id="span2">When </span>using the bandsaw it is important to keep your fingers at least 50mm away from the blade and stand in front of the blade.
                        Adjust the top of the blade approximately 6 mm above the material to be cut and always cut on the waste side of the line.
                        When removing small scrap pieces all use a wooden stick.

                        Keep your fingers at least four inches away from the sander and do not push the material too hard against the machine.
                        The wood must be positioned against the table at all times when using the machine.

                                If using the router table keep your hands far away from the rotating bit and make sure the fence is secure if the router has one.
